# annutrilib
A nutrition library

This library makes it easier to use Edamam's nutrition api (https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-nutrition-api). You would still need to sign up for an app_id and app_key through their platform (it's free for developers), but you can use the methods below to get nutrition data for ingredients or recipes.
